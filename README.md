# Meteorological-Data-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project, conducted in 2020, involved the analysis of meteorological data using Fourier Transform and Harmonic Regression techniques to uncover weather patterns and trends. The primary goal was to gain insights into meteorological phenomena and provide valuable information for weather-related research and its proposley historical influence.

## Project Overview

In this project, we applied the following data analysis techniques:
* Fourier Transform: Used to decompose time-series meteorological data into its constituent frequencies, revealing periodic patterns and seasonal variations.

* Harmonic Regression: Utilized to model and forecast meteorological phenomena based on the harmonics extracted from the raw data.
